# nne
 
A customizable nne (nations not endorsing [the delegate]) script for [NationStates](https://www.nationstates.net/). 

## Usage
1. Download the repository to your local machine and extract it.
2. Create a file called ``template.txt`` containing the template for your NNE dispatch. Insert the key ``$nations`` where you would like the script to input the nation names.
3. Copy the [config.yml.template](https://github.com/nsupc/nne/blob/main/config.yml.template) file and rename it to ``config.yml``. Configure it with your data.
4. Run [main.py](https://github.com/nsupc/nne/blob/main/main.py)`. Note that it is recommended that you use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), but the script can be run normally once you have installed the dependencies found in the [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/nsupc/nne/blob/main/pyproject.toml) file.
